# Sample React App with Redux served using an Express server

## node backend server
`cd backend`
`npm start`

## dev frontend server
`cd frontend`
`npm start`

## NOTES
The app assumes there's a build directory in `frontend` that it can serve at the root endpoint `/`. This is suitable for production.

For development use a typical workflow where you MUST run the frontend dev server as well as the backend server together!

Happy Coding!
